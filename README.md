# ui-accessibility
I made a accessible contact sheet
I checked it with Wave eveluation tool, after I got their feedback I fixed what was wrong and ended up with 0 errors so my site should be accessible
I really recomend getting the Wave tool for accessibility and also for checking other peoples works while reveiwing. 

I learnt a lot about accessibility (for example that I always write it incorrectly) and how much it affects people with many disabilities to have an accsessible website they can navigate.
I used the aria-label on my input fields so text to speech apps should read what the fields are saying.

The last part (after send button) is supposed to appear after you press send, with more time I would have added javascript to make that happen. But you can imagine what that would look like! :)
